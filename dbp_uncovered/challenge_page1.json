    "question": "What does DBP stand for?",
    "options": [
      "Disinfection By-Product",
      "Dissolved Biochemical Particles",
      "Drinking Base Pollutant"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Disinfection By-Product",
    "explanation": "DBPs are chemicals formed when disinfectants like chlorine react with natural matter in water.",
    "learning_content": "DBPs are unintended chemical by-products from disinfecting water.",
    "Clue": "Think about what’s left behind after disinfecting water."

    "id": "c1q2",
    "question": "When are DBPs most likely to form?",
    "options": [
      "When water is frozen",
      "When chlorine reacts with organic matter",
      "During water boiling"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "When chlorine reacts with organic matter",
    "explanation": "Chlorine disinfects water but reacts with leaves, soil, and other organic material to form DBPs.",
    "learning_content": "Chlorine + natural matter = DBPs.",
    "Clue": "Disinfection reactions with natural stuff can cause unexpected results."
  },
  {
    "id": "c1q3",

    "options": [
      "Chlorine",
      "Fluoride",
      "Baking soda"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Chlorine",
    "explanation": "Chlorine is commonly used to kill germs but also forms DBPs when it reacts with organic material.",
    "learning_content": "Chlorine helps disinfect water but can also create harmful by-products.",
    "Clue": "It’s the go-to chemical for killing germs in drinking water."
  },
  {
    "id": "c1q4",
    "question": "Why are DBPs found more in treated water than in natural water sources?",
    "options": [
      "Natural water is always clean",
      "DBPs are only added by factories",
      "DBPs form during disinfection"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "DBPs form during disinfection",
    "explanation": "Disinfection is meant to clean water, but this process can also create DBPs.",
    "learning_content": "Disinfection helps safety, but also creates DBPs.",
    "Clue": "Treated water is safer, but chemical reactions come with trade-offs."
  },
  {
    "id": "c1q5",
    "question": "Which condition can increase DBP formation?",
    "options": [
      "Cold water",
      "High organic matter",
      "Low pH"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "High organic matter",
    "explanation": "More natural material in water increases chances for DBP formation when disinfectants are added.",
    "learning_content": "More natural material = more DBPs if disinfectants are used.",
    "Clue": "More stuff floating in your water = more reactions during treatment."
