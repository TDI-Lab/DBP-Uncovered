    "question": "Which of these is a common type of DBP found in tap water?",
    "options": [
      "Trihalomethanes (THMs)",
      "Hydrochloric acid",
      "Sodium bicarbonate"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Trihalomethanes (THMs)",
    "explanation": "THMs are among the most common DBPs and are monitored in drinking water worldwide.",
    "learning_content": "THMs are a key group of DBPs that can form during water disinfection.",
    "Clue": "This group of DBPs is widely tracked in drinking water systems."
  },
  {
    "id": "c2q2",
    "question": "Which of the following is another major DBP group besides THMs?",
    "options": [
      "Haloacetic acids (HAAs)",
      "Chlorophyll",
      "Carbon monoxide"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Haloacetic acids (HAAs)",
    "explanation": "HAAs are another regulated class of DBPs formed during disinfection with chlorine.",
    "learning_content": "HAAs are common DBPs, along with THMs.",
    "Clue": "These acids form during disinfection, just like THMs."
  },
  {
    "id": "c2q3",
    "question": "What do both THMs and HAAs have in common?",
    "options": [
      "They are natural minerals",
      "They are formed during water disinfection",
      "They clean the water"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "They are formed during water disinfection",
    "explanation": "Both THMs and HAAs are produced when disinfectants like chlorine react with organic matter.",
    "learning_content": "THMs and HAAs are formed by disinfectants reacting with organic materials.",
    "Clue": "They’re both created as a result of water treatment."
  },
  {
    "id": "c2q4",
    "question": "Which of these is the best description of DBP types?",
    "options": [
      "All harmless minerals",
      "Groups of chemicals formed during disinfection",
      "Vitamins added to water"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Groups of chemicals formed during disinfection",
    "explanation": "DBPs include several chemical groups like THMs and HAAs, formed as by-products of disinfection.",
    "learning_content": "DBPs are chemical groups unintentionally created during water treatment.",
    "Clue": "Think about what’s created unintentionally while cleaning water."
  },
  {
    "id": "c2q5",
    "question": "Why are some DBPs grouped into types like THMs and HAAs?",
    "options": [
      "Because they taste different",
      "To help regulate and monitor them",
      "For branding purposes"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "To help regulate and monitor them",
    "explanation": "Grouping DBPs helps scientists and governments monitor and control their presence in water supplies.",
    "learning_content": "Grouping DBPs (e.g., THMs, HAAs) helps track and control them in water.",
    "Clue": "Labeling things makes it easier for scientists and regulators to keep track."
