  {
    "id": "c4q1",
    "question": "Which of the following can help reduce DBPs in drinking water?",
    "options": [
      "Using a water filter",
      "Carbonating water",
      "Using BPA plastics"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Using a water filter",
    "explanation": "Filters can remove DBPs and other chemicals from tap water.",
    "learning_content": "Use certified filters (like carbon-based) to reduce DBPs at home.",
    "Clue": "It’s a common appliance used right at the tap."
  },
  {
    "id": "c4q2",
    "question": "What is a simple way to reduce DBPs from hot water use?",
    "options": [
      "Take shorter showers",
      "Add soap to your water",
      "Use only cold water for cooking"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Take shorter showers",
    "explanation": "Shorter showers reduce steam inhalation and overall DBP exposure from hot water.",
    "learning_content": "Shorter hot showers = less DBP exposure.",
    "Clue": "Less time with steam means less exposure."
  },
  {
    "id": "c4q3",
    "question": "How does ventilation help during hot water use?",
    "options": [
      "It cools down the room",
      "It removes DBPs from the air",
      "It makes the water cleaner"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "It removes DBPs from the air",
    "explanation": "Good ventilation helps clear DBPs released in steam during activities like showering.",
    "learning_content": "Open a window or use a fan to lower airborne DBP exposure.",
    "Clue": "Air movement can clear out more than just heat."
  },
  {
    "id": "c4q4",
    "question": "Which water source is typically lower in DBPs?",
    "options": [
      "Tap water",
      "Filtered water",
      "Pool water"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Filtered water",
    "explanation": "Filtered water can significantly reduce DBP levels.",
    "learning_content": "Filtered water usually contains fewer DBPs than untreated tap water.",
    "Clue": "It’s been cleaned a step further than regular tap water."
  },
  {
    "id": "c4q5",
    "question": "Why shouldn't you rely only on boiling water to remove DBPs?",
    "options": [
      "It can increase some DBPs",
      "It removes all chemicals",
      "It makes the water fizzy"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "It can increase some DBPs",
    "explanation": "Boiling can concentrate certain DBPs instead of removing them.",
    "learning_content": "Boiling water doesn’t always reduce DBPs—use proper filtration instead.",
    "Clue": "Heat doesn’t always mean safer, it might intensify certain things."
